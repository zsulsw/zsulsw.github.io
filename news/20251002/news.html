<h1>MSASect2 Version 2.0 Released</h1>
<p class="news-meta">2 Oct 2025</p>
<p>
  The development team is proud to present <strong>MSASect2 v2.0</strong>, a major
  upgrade to our cross‑section analysis software.  This release
  introduces enhanced algorithms for section and member buckling,
  improved finite strip and shell finite element capabilities, and a
  streamlined user interface for easier model input and result
  visualisation.
</p>
<p>
  Version 2.0 also adds support for functionally graded sections and
  better integration with external CAD tools via DXF and CSV import.
  We would like to thank the many users and collaborators who
  provided feedback and contributed code patches.  Download the new
  version from our GitHub repository or our dedicated website and
  explore the documentation to learn more about the new features.
