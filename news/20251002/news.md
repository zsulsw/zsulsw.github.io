# MSASect2 Version 2.0 Released

![MSASect2 Version 2.0 Released](cover.jpg)

**2 Oct 2025**

The development team is proud to present **MSASect2 v2.0**, a major upgrade to our cross‑section analysis software.  This release introduces enhanced algorithms for section and member buckling, improved finite strip and shell finite element capabilities, and a streamlined user interface for easier model input and result visualisation.

Version 2.0 also adds support for functionally graded sections and better integration with external CAD tools via DXF and CSV import.  We would like to thank the many users and collaborators who provided feedback and contributed code patches.  Download the new version from our GitHub repository or our dedicated website and explore the documentation to learn more about the new features.
