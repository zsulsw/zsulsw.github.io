<h1>New Publication in <em>Structures</em></h1>
<p class="news-meta">3 Oct 2025</p>
<p>
  Our paper entitled “Refined FE‑based cross‑section analysis for line
  element simulation of WAAM steel members considering anisotropy” has
  been accepted for publication in the journal <em>Structures</em>.  In this
  work we propose a finite element based formulation that captures the
  anisotropic material properties of WAAM‑printed steel and
  provides accurate predictions of cross‑sectional stiffness and
  stability.  The method is validated against experimental data and
  provides the foundation for improved member buckling models.

  This publication represents a significant milestone in our ongoing
  efforts to develop comprehensive analysis tools for 3D‑printed
  metallic structures.  We thank our co‑authors and collaborators for
  their contributions and look forward to sharing the full paper once
  it is published online.
