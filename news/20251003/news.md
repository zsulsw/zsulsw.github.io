# New Publication in *Structures*

![New Publication in Structures](cover.jpg)

**3 Oct 2025**

Our paper entitled “Refined FE‑based cross‑section analysis for line element simulation of WAAM steel members considering anisotropy” has been accepted for publication in the journal *Structures*.  In this work we propose a finite element based formulation that captures the anisotropic material properties of WAAM‑printed steel and provides accurate predictions of cross‑sectional stiffness and stability.  The method is validated against experimental data and provides the foundation for improved member buckling models.

This publication represents a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to develop comprehensive analysis tools for 3D‑printed metallic structures.  We thank our co‑authors and collaborators for their contributions and look forward to sharing the full paper once it is published online.
