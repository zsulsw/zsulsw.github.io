# Launch of WAAM Research Initiative

![Launch of WAAM Research Initiative](cover.jpg)

**1 Sep 2024**

We are delighted to announce that our research group has secured a major grant to advance the science and design of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) steel structures.  Over the next three years we will develop new analytical models, experimental programmes and design guidelines to enable architects and engineers to exploit the potential of 3D‑printed metal members.  The project will also contribute open‑source computational tools and share our findings with the broader engineering community.

WAAM technology allows for rapid fabrication of customised steel components by depositing molten metal layer by layer.  Our research focuses on understanding the anisotropic mechanical properties of WAAM‑printed materials, predicting their buckling behaviour, and developing robust methods for cross‑sectional and global stability analysis.  Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting journey.
