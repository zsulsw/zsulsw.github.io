<h1>Launch of WAAM Research Initiative</h1>
<p class="news-meta">1 Sep 2024</p>
<p>
  We are delighted to announce that our research group has secured a
  major grant to advance the science and design of Wire Arc Additive
  Manufacturing (WAAM) steel structures.  Over the next three years
  we will develop new analytical models, experimental programmes and
  design guidelines to enable architects and engineers to exploit the
  potential of 3D‑printed metal members.  The project will also
  contribute open‑source computational tools and share our findings
  with the broader engineering community.

  WAAM technology allows for rapid fabrication of customised
  steel components by depositing molten metal layer by layer.  Our
  research focuses on understanding the anisotropic mechanical
  properties of WAAM‑printed materials, predicting their buckling
  behaviour, and developing robust methods for cross‑sectional and
  global stability analysis.  Stay tuned for updates as we
  embark on this exciting journey.
