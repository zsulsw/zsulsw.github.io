        <h2>Steel &amp; Composite Structures</h2>
        <p>We develop advanced direct analysis methods to accurately capture the nonlinear behaviour of steel and composite structural systems.  Our work includes buckling analyses of thin‑walled members, lateral‑torsional buckling of beams with warping restraints, and performance‑based design methodologies under fire and high temperatures.  The outcomes have influenced international design codes and led to award‑winning applications.</p>
